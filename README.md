This project uses data mining techniques to crawl data from Red and Flickr.com. It also adopts machine learning skills to conduct human face detection and image analysis. This project uses Poisson model to test the image effect on users' social media engagement.

Beauty of Pictures: Image Engagement in Cosmetic Industry

Research Questions: 
1. What features can cosmetics product pictures create more engagement on social media platforms?
2. Do these affect characteristics vary from different categories of cosmetics products?

Process description:
We collect our posts from Flickr.com as training set and RED application as test set. Then we filter some irrelevant and use machine learning tools to conduct image processing for the 
images in those posts to capture the sharpness, color richness and detect human face. After that, we do some data cleaning to fit our factors into the model. For model selection, we select Poisson regression 
in count model to do our analysis. 
The result can be divided into two parts. Regarding research question 1, we found that image characteristics do have effect on our measurement of engagement. And regrading research question 2, 
for two types of makeups: foundation and lipstick, they have different engagement effects on some image features. For example, human face shows negative effect on user engagement for foundation, 
but show positive effect for lipstick. This provides a view for future makeup brands in terms of advertising on social media, since they may adopt different strategies to select and post images in terms 
of different types of cosmetics.
